 * Definition, Section 4.2 and 4.4
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - Types are references so that unification can work via side effects.
 *     We need links (forwards) to unify two type variables.
 *   - Types built bottom-up have to be `normalised' to induce the required
 *     sharing on type variables.
 *   - Care has to be taken to clone types at the proper places.
 *   - Undetermined types are represented separately from type variables.
 *     They carry an additional time stamp to detect attempts of referring
 *     types not in scope. The time stamps are also used to prevent invalid
 *     unification with skolem types (i.e. newer type names) during signature
 *     matching. Time stamps are propagated during unification.
 *   - Substitution creates a clone, but shares undetermined types.
 *   - To represent overloaded type (variables), we add a special type.
 *   - Record types may contain a row variable to represent open record types
 *     (which appear during type inference). Flexible rows have to carry an
 *     equality flag and time stamp to properly propagate information enforced
 *     by unification when extending a row.
